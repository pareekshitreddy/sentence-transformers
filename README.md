# Multi-Task Sentence Transformer Project

This repository contains a minimal demonstration of how to:
1. Implement a **Sentence Transformer** model to produce fixed-length sentence embeddings.
2. Expand that model into a **Multi-Task** architecture capable of producing outputs for multiple NLP tasks simultaneously.
3. Provide a brief **discussion** on training strategies and considerations for multi-task learning, including **when to freeze** parts of the network, **when to use** multi-task models vs. separate models, and **how to handle** data imbalance.

## Overview

### Step 1: Sentence Transformer

- **Goal**: Convert input sentences into fixed-length embeddings.
- **Approach**: 
  1. Leverage a pretrained model (e.g., BERT).
  2. Optionally apply different pooling strategies (CLS pooling, mean pooling) for the final sentence representation.
  3. (Optional) Add a projection layer to modify the embedding dimension.

### Step 2: Multi-Task Expansion

- **Goal**: Share the same backbone but produce outputs for multiple tasks.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Sentence Classification (Task A)** — e.g., classify a sentence into different categories (sentiment, topic, etc.).
  2. **Another NLP task (Task B)** — e.g., Named Entity Recognition (NER) or a second classification task.
- **Approach**:
  1. Use the same backbone (transformer) for the shared feature representation.
  2. Add separate heads for each task.

### Step 3: Discussion

- **Freezing vs. Training** which parts of the network in multi-task learning.
- **Choosing** between multi-task vs. separate models.
- **Managing data imbalance** between tasks.

- **`model.py`** contains two classes:
  - `SentenceTransformer` (single-task model)
  - `MultiTaskSentenceTransformer` (multi-task model)
- **`main.py`** shows how to instantiate and test the models with sample data.
- **`discussion.md`** (optional) can contain a more detailed write-up of the discussion questions.
